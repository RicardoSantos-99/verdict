# Verdict

Model evaluation plots for [Nx](https://github.com/elixir-nx/nx). Confusion
matrices, ROC and precision-recall curves, calibration, residuals,
projections, and the rest of what you look at after training something.

Scholar computes these metrics and hands back tensors. Verdict turns tensors
into [Vega-Lite](https://vega.github.io/vega-lite/) specs, which Livebook
renders on its own.

Nothing here assumes a modelling library. Pass the tensors your model
produced, whether they came from Scholar, Axon, or a hand-rolled `defn`.

## Installation

Add to your `mix.exs`:

```elixir
def deps do
  [
    {:verdict, "~> 0.1.0"}
  ]
end
```

### Notebooks

```elixir
Mix.install([
  {:verdict, "~> 0.1.0"},
  {:kino_vega_lite, "~> 0.1"}
])
```

> #### kino_vega_lite, not kino {: .warning}
>
> The `Kino.Render` implementation for `VegaLite` ships in `kino_vega_lite`.
> Without it, Livebook prints the struct instead of drawing the chart.

## Getting started

One call for the usual screen:

```elixir
Verdict.report(y_true, scores, class_names: ["negative", "positive"])
```

That is a confusion matrix, the ROC and precision-recall curves, and the
scores split by true class. The matrix and the histogram read the same
`:threshold`, so it shows what one cut-off does rather than four unrelated
views. `kind: :regression` swaps in the regression set.

Every function returns a `VegaLite` struct, so you can keep going:

```elixir
Verdict.roc_curve(y_true, scores, title: "Held-out set")
|> VegaLite.config(axis: [grid: false])
```

To build your own screen, use `Verdict.grid/2`.

A plot with more points than the frame can separate is a cloud until you can
get inside it. `Verdict.zoomable/2` binds a drag and the scroll wheel to the
axes, on every view of a screen at once:

```elixir
Verdict.report(y_true, scores) |> Verdict.zoomable()
```

## What's in it

**Classification.** Confusion matrix, ROC, precision-recall, DET, calibration,
threshold curve, cumulative gain, lift, and scores split by true class. All of
them take a list of models to compare, and a score matrix for one-vs-rest
multiclass with micro and macro averages.

**Regression.** Predicted against actual, residuals, their distribution, and a
normal Q-Q.

**Clustering and decomposition.** Dendrogram, silhouette, OPTICS reachability,
elbow, PCA scree, 2-D projection, biplot, and a loadings heatmap.

**Model selection.** Learning curve, validation curve, grid search heatmap,
and per-fold scores, all reading what `Scholar.ModelSelection` returns.

**Everything else.** Coefficients, correlation matrix, feature distribution by
class, sample weights across the counting plots, faceting when a one-vs-rest
overlay gets crowded, and drag-to-zoom on any plot whose axes are continuous.

The [tour](notebooks/tour.livemd) walks through every plot with generated
data, including models that are deliberately wrong so you can see what that
looks like.

## Correctness

Values are checked against scikit-learn and SciPy where a reference exists,
curve points included: the one-vs-rest averages, the calibration binning, the
dendrogram's leaf order and bracket coordinates, and the Q-Q plot's positions
and fitted line. Sample weights are pinned to their definition, which is that
a weight of two matches the same data with that row duplicated.
